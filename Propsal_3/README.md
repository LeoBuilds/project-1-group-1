## Proposal
#### Description
U-haul is of the past, now weHaul. 
You have a piece of furniture, or home improvement material, or your parents couch that you want to take to your new apartment, or a dishwasher that you just bought or your old bed set that you want to move to your vacation home and you only not need a truck but also a person to hold the other side of the couch. 
#### How it works 
You go on the app or website, put origin address, destination address, and when you need it moved. Next page will ask you on what day you need to move, and the type of truck that you would need. On final page, it will calculate the price and when you submit, it will match a driver from the pool of drivers who are available at that time and then who is closest to your address.
#### APIs to be used
