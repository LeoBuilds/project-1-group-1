## Proposal

### Summary
A website that streamlines the process of appealing your property tax appraisal value for yearly property taxes.  The goal is to take the work out of the appeal process and allow it all to be done quickly and easily using the website.
#### Description
The site will allow users to input their information in order to get their current property appraisal.  The user can then complete more searches to find out if this value is accurate or is too high.  This information can then be used by them as their evidence to include if proceeding with an appeal.  The home information will come from searching Zillow, MLS, possibly HAR to find values of comparable homes recently sold.  The user will get an estimated difference in the county’s tax value and what the value should be based on these results.  Based on the results, the site will suggest if an appeal is worthwhile or if the county’s assessment is valid.  If an appeal is to be made, the user can input additional information which will then be added to the appeal form (Form 41-44) that is needed to protest your property value with the county.  User can then print this form and any additional evidence gathered by the site.   
#### Potential API's to Use
* Find a site similar to Google Earth that provides satellite images of homes - To print pictures of home
* Zillow API (https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/GetSearchResults.htm) - To get the current appraised value (non-taxed)
* MLS or some other API - To get values of nearby comps
* Google Maps API - To find the tax office and give directions
